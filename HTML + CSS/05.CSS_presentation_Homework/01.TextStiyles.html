             Although I could go on and on about this subject, 
            the newly released U.S. News Best Diets rankings have made my job easier. 
            U.S. News evaluates and rates 29 different diets, from popular commercial 
            plans (such as Weight Watchers, Atkins, and Medifast) to eating approaches, 
            like veganism and the raw food diet. These diets were not based upon quick fixes 
            that typically provide speedy weight loss and even speedier regain. Rather, 
            "We paid attention to what's trending in the diet world, and we focused on including 
            diets that cater to different goals, such as weight loss, heart health, and diabetes prevention and management," 
            said Angela Haupt, U.S. News's health and wellness editor.
